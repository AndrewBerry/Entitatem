Entitatem is a light weight framework that allows developers to easily manage entities and game logic.
Component-entity-systems are an easy and manageable way to break away from old fashioned rigid class hierarchies. Boreal Games has a great explanation of component based entity systems [here](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013).

For an example of how to use Entitatem, see [wiki/ecs-example1](https://github.com/AndrewBerry/Entitatem/wiki/ecs_example1).
